# Nextstrain CLI

It's quite likely that you'll have a project involving a nextstrain build or using augur or other parts of the nextstrain ecosystem.

Installation instructions for getting the nextstrain-cli up and running can be found [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli).

Once the installation is complete you can test things out by working through the Zika tutorial linked [here](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/zika-tutorial/).
