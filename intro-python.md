# Introduction to Python

If you're completely new to programming, don't fear! Many of us in the lab started in the same boat. Some of the best teaching materials for teaching programming to beginners is put out by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a community-based organization dedicated to teaching foundational programming and data science skills to researchers. Their intro lessons are designed for people who have never coded before, so if that's you, this should be tailored exactly for you! They run in person workshops, and if one happens to be running when you join the lab, you should absolutely sign up for it. If however there isn't one running, we recommend working through the materials on your own.

To start, there's some set-up that you'll need to do to make sure you have all the data file and such necessary for the tutorial. You can find that [here](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/setup.html).

At this point you should have jupyter installed on your computer. If not, [head back here](./jupyter-notebook.md). We recommend running the code in a jupyter notebook (option 2 in the Carpentries set-up documentation).

Once you have that settled, you can work through the introductory Python lessons that are put out through Data Carpentry. We are going to use [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). You'll see under `schedule` that there are a bunch of different lessons. We suggest working through the lessons (and actively coding, not just reading through them) in order. You should skip lessons 7, 8 and 10; these teach tools/packages that we don't use as regularly in the lab.
