# Jupyter notebooks

Most of us in the lab use Jupyter notebooks for programming. These are really nice notebooks that can run blocks of code independently and allow plots and output to show up inline. They also allow you to have cells that run markdown, which means you can make pretty notes in your code describing what you're doing and why, which increases the readability of your code.

So if you don't have Jupyter installed already, we recommend getting this going as one of the first things you do.
