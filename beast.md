# BEAST

BEAST is a common piece of software we use for inferring phylogenetic trees.

Trevor made a great step-by-step introduction to using BEAST that you can find [here](https://bedford.io/projects/dynamics-practical/). This practical will link you out to the required software for running BEAST and also teach you how to set up BEAST runs _and_ interpret the results at different steps.
