# Introductory Resources for the Bedford Lab

Welcome to the Bedford Lab!

This repository is where we keep introductory materials for the lab. Whether you're new to programming, new to genomic epidemiology, or just new to the lab, the materials here should help you get up and running when you first join the lab. Here you can find information on common ways lab members set up their computational environments as well as learning materials. Here we have instructions and link outs to good introductory material for learning computational things, such as programming, git, and the unix shell. We also have recommended readings centered around common scientific concepts in the lab such as genomic epidemiology, phylogenetics, population genetics etc.
